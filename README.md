# Simple-Todos
My first Meteor.js app! The tutorial helps one to build a todo list that takes advantage of CRUD and uses MongoDB. 

The tutorial documentation is located [here](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/).

### Setup
When installing Simple-Todos on a new machine (with Meteor already installed), run:
1. *meteor* // Starts the app and installs dependencies.
2. *meteor update* // Updates dependencies listed in [.meteor/versions](.meteor/versions).
3. *meteor npm install --save react react-dom* // Installs react packages.

### Notes
- Turn off any antivirus programs for a few minutes if the extracting process seems neverending.
  - Task Manager will inform one that the problematic antivirus program is eating up a lot of CPU power or RAM.
  - Here's a [forum post](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/7688) discussing the issue in depth.
- MongoDB should be ready to go out of the gate.
- If the app crashes, updates may have not been fully installed yet.
